ProjectMonitor
==============

A Node Module to restart your project automatically if any file has changed.

=============

This used `Cluster` and `fs.watchFile` module in NODE api, but they are unstable ,so use it carefully pls.

ï¼¨ow does it works?

1.  Get all files and folds in given path.
2.  Then wath them by `fs.watchFile` , when it changed , I will catch them .and callback a method with an `EventEmitter`
3.  Restart App : I use `cluster` to folk 2 process at least , and disconnect the first one when file changed.

As you know , such as a http server, it must be running in a child process. so you can't get the server instance in master,
so I send messages from master to fork. to tell child what should him do .


Note:
It only is a Experimental project . I will improve and perfect it soon.
